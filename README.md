# Legibility App

Legibility App is an old quick-n-dirty prototype by @viljamis for user interface designers for evaluating typeface legibility under different viewing conditions. Some features might not work in all browsers anymore.

## Usage:

1. `npm install gulp`

2. `npm install gulp-ruby-sass`

3. `npm install --save-dev browser-sync`

4. `gulp serve`
